	* buildbot/status/web/*.py: move all web status stuff into a
	separate directory, in anticipation of splitting it into smaller
	pieces and adding more files. html.py was getting way too big.
	* buildbot/status/classic.css: move it too
	* setup.py: add the new sub-package
	* buildbot/test/test_web.py: match the changes
