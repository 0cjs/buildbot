still to do:

 repourl vs repoURL, make it consistent in docs and code
 it would be nice to name this Bazaar, instead of Bzr. Need a transition
  plan for the old baz step.
  old: Arch (tla), Bazaar (baz)
  new?: Arch (tla), Baz (baz), Bazaar (bzr)
 use of 'bzr version-info' vs 'bzr revno', maybe a bzr bug
