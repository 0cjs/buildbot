    Buildbot now uses towncrier to manage its release notes.
    towncrier helps to avoid the need for rebase when several people work at the same time on the releasenote files.

    Each PR should come with a file in the master/buildbot/newsfragment directory


Release notes for older versions of Buildbot are available in the :src:`master/docs/relnotes/` directory of the source tree.
Newer versions are also available here:
