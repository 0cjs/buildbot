When running buildbot with python3, the following API call: 

/api/v2/builders/<int>/builds&property=* 

or any property filter for that matter does not return the expected set of
filters but instead returns an empty dictionary {}.

The fix is to compare the right types of variables - string vs binary.

In python 2 the b'' prefix is ignored so it shouldn't break changes there.
