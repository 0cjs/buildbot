	* buildbot/changes/svnpoller.py (SvnSource.create_changes):
	de-unicodify filenames before creating the Change, because the
	rest of buildbot is unlikely to handle them well. Leave the 'who'
	field as a unicode object.. I don't think there's anything that
	will break very soon, and it will probably nudge us towards
	accepting unicode everywhere sooner or later. Stop using the
	"date" field that comes out of SVN, since it is using the
	repository's clock (and timezone) and what we care about is the
	buildmaster's (otherwise Changes from the future show up later
	than the builds they triggered).
	* buildbot/test/test_svnpoller.py (Everything.test1): match the
	change to .when

	* buildbot/changes/svnpoller.py (SvnSource): added Niklaus Giger's
	Suvbersion repository polling ChangeSource. I've hacked it up
	considerably: any bugs are entirely my own fault. Thank you
	Niklaus!
	* buildbot/test/test_svnpoller.py: tests for it
	* docs/buildbot.texinfo (SvnSource): document it
